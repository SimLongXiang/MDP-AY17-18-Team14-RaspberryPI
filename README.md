# Introduction
The Multidisciplinary Design Project (MDP) is a group-based design project undertaken by a mixed group of students comprising of undergraduates from the CE, CS, BCG and BCE programmes. The project is practical-oriented and multi-disciplinary in nature, requiring system level integration of subsystems developed by different team members.

# Objective
The objective of MDP is to create a mobile robotic machine to complete a maze challenge. The maze challenge consist of 2 parts: Exploration and Speedrun. Scores will be given based on the timing of completion. The project is spilt into 4 segment:

- Android UI that shows the maze and robot movement during the run
- Robot assembly using motors and microchips provided by the school
- Raspberry PI to facilitate wireless/wired communication between Android Nexus touchpad, Arduino Chip and the Algorithm itself 
- Algorithm code that determine the optimal solution in completing the maze
